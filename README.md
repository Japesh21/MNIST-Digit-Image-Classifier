# MNIST Digit Image Classifier

This repository contains a simple machine learning model that classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is built using Python and utilizes popular machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Overview

The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The goal of this project is to create a model that can accurately classify these digits. This project demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using deep learning techniques.

## Features

- Preprocessing of MNIST dataset for training and testing.
- Neural network built with Keras/TensorFlow.
- Model evaluation with accuracy metrics.
- Model training with hyperparameter tuning.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**: Programming language used.
- **TensorFlow**: Deep learning library for building and training models.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API running on top of TensorFlow.
- **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations and matrix manipulations.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for visualizing data.
- **Pandas**: Data analysis library used for managing datasets.
